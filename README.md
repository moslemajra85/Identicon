**Features**

- 5 by 5 grid of squares
- Each square on the grid has height and width of 50px

## How To Make it

Based on the input string we will generate a hash using md5 algorithm.

```
iex> binary  = :crypto.hash(:md5, "apple")
<<31, 56, 112, 190, 39, 79, 108, 73, 179, 227, 26, 12, 103, 40, 149, 127>>
iex> :binary.bin_to_list(binary)          
[31, 56, 112, 190, 39, 79, 108, 73, 179, 227, 26, 12, 103, 40, 149, 127]
iex> 



```
We will use the __first three items__ of the generated hash list in order to pick up a color for our identicon. since every item is a number between 0 and 256 we could easily use any three items to generate an rgb color.

 `e.g: rgb(31, 56, 112)`
